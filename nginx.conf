# Nginx commands are stored in this file. This file is never automatically loaded by Nginx and 
# commands and configuration from this file should be set to Nginx server configuration. These 
# commands redirect all HTTP requests, except those to /static/ folders and those that are PHP 
# files itself, to Index Gateway stored in /index.php. These commands and Wave Framework itself 
# only work when URL rewriting is supported.

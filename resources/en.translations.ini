; Translations
; 
; Translations are stored in an INI file that lists all the translation keywords for all 
; languages - with one translations file per language - and these files are used by View 
; Controller and the Views loaded by the View Controller to display appropriate 
; translations in the views.
;
; Please note that INI files have certain reserved words which throw an error if they are 
; used as keywords for translations. To make sure that you do not encounter these errors, 
; do not use the following as translation keys: null, yes, no, true, false, on, off, none

; Sitemap Declaration
; 
; Sitemap is an INI file that defines all the URL's for all the languages - with one sitemap 
; file per language - and these files are used by the URL Controller to find a match in URL 
; and apply a number of settings to the page. Sitemap has groups that act as URL keywords,
; separated by forward slash '/' characters. URL nodes can also be dynamic and include a 
; regular expression or fixed list.
;
; Reference for dynamic URL nodes:
; * :numeric: - Numbers only
; * :numeric:1-20 - Numbers with the range of 1-20
; * :alpha: - Letters only
; * :alpha:1-10 - Letter string with the length of 1-10 characters
; * :alphanumeric: - Letters and numbers only
; * :alphanumeric:1-10 - Letters and numbers with the length of 1-10 characters
; * :fixed:a,b,c - Fixed value from the comma-separated list
; * :any: - Allows for any character string, except '/' which is the node separator
; * :any:/^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$/u - After ':any:' key you can write a regular expression for matched characters
;

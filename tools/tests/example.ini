; Example Test
; 
; This is a generic example of a test that Test Suite can run. Multiple tests can be defined 
; in the same file as multiple INI groups can be defined here. Every group must be followed 
; by 'input' and 'output' groups for the tests to be run. All of the tests of the same file 
; will use the same API session for running. If you want to make sure that State and API 
; sessions are different, then store these tests in separate files.
;
; Input and output values can be defined as
; * :numeric: - Numbers only
; * :numeric:1-20 - Numbers with the range of 1-20
; * :alpha: - Letters only
; * :alpha:1-10 - Letter string with the length of 1-10 characters
; * :alphanumeric: - Letters and numbers only
; * :alphanumeric:1-10 - Letters and numbers with the length of 1-10 characters
; * :fixed:a,b,c - Fixed value from the comma-separated list
